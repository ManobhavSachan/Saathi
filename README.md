## Inspiration
There are tons of people who are completely unware of the schemes of our government and various NGO's. And this is what inspired us. That how we can make people aware of these schemes and various benefits that are waiting for them. This will not only help the people to improve their current standard of living and all but also help them to live a worthy life that they deserve.

## What it does
In a nutshell, it is an app. Its name is Saathi. Your companion in English if you don't know hindi. As the name goes, its sole motive is to help you get aware of all the schemes and benefits that are waiting for you. It will not only educate you but also help you to connect with crores of people across country on forums feature and let you know the schemes info, applicability, reach and the link for where to apply.

## How we built it
We have built it with sheer amount of the hardwork and dedication, shoutout to Ankit for his extra efforts. So, the answer you were expecting is with android studio.

## Challenges we ran into
Well there were so many of challenges. But we somehow overcame them. As we are second year students of elecrical, our programming ability was limited and that too we have to communicate with everyone being hundreds of kilometer away from each other. "Setting up recyclerview was difficult and Working with lot of files created bug so had to debug it. Using intent with scroll view was challenging." But due to the ever supporting team members we jumped over all the hurdles that came along as a team, special thanks to Milind for supporting the app development and giving us this wonderful idea.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
What we are proud of? Hmm.. well everything from the app we built to wonderful team journey that we had. Also we got to know about the strengths and our weakness too. We also have successfully managed to create a fully working feature rich app on our first hackathon only.

## What we learned
Well as a team we got to know how to communicate with each other and value each others abilities and strengths. We also got the scope of improving the apps, thanks to the cheerful support of girlscript goa team.

## What's next for Saathi
Apart from improving the app interface, we have decided to add the fully functional forums features which will help to people connect to each other. We will also add the option for adding more schemes that people will come across. So, our final motive is to make it a community driven app, where people will help each other. Its also explained in the ppt shared by us, honorary mention of Teja for creating a great ppt.

Hope our projects was up to the standard of this great Hackathon. I, Manobhav would like to end it with a moment of thanks for providing us this wonderful opportunity to Girlscript, and a promise that we will do even better in future Hackathons... Thanks.
